*[Source Doc](CPH2024_Preliminary_Report.pdf)*

## Executive Summary

- The enumeration stage of the Census of Population and Housing 2024, the 15th census in Sri Lanka's series of censuses, was conducted from **October 2024 to the second week of February 2025**. The census moment was 00:00 hours on 19th December 2024.
- According to this census, the population of Sri Lanka was recorded as **21,763,170**.
- This census has shown an increase of 1,403,731 compared to the population reported in the Census of Population and Housing 2012.
- During the 2001-2012 inter-census period, the average annual population growth rate was 0.7 percent. For the 2012-2024 inter-census period, the average annual population growth rate is **0.5 percent**. This indicates that while the population growth rate in Sri
Lanka has slowed, the population continues to increase.
- When considering the population by province in Sri Lanka, the **Western Province** has the highest population, accounting for 28.1 percent of the total, while the Northern Province has the lowest, with 5.3 percent of the total population.
- When considering the population distribution at the district level, **Gampaha District** has reported the highest population, with 2,433,685 persons. Colombo District follows, with a population of 2,374,461. Together, only these two districts have a population of over 2 million.
- Apart from Gampaha and Colombo districts, the **highest population** is reported from Kurunegala (1,760,829), Kandy (1,461,269), Kalutara (1,305,552), Ratnapura (1,145,138), and Galle (1,096,585) districts respectively, with each of these districts reporting a population of more than one million.
- As in the previous censuses, districts with the **lowest population** in the country this time are Mullaitivu (122,542), Mannar (123,674), Kilinochchi (136,434) and Vavuniya (172,257) districts in the Northern Province.
- The **highest annual growth rate** of 2.23 percent has been reported from Mullaitivu district. The **lowest annual growth rate** is recorded in Vavuniya District (0.01 percent).
- As in previous censuses, the **highest population density** of 3,549 persons per square kilometer is reported in Colombo District, while the lowest population density is reported in Mullaitivu District, which has a population density of 50 persons per square
kilometer.

1. Postponement: The 15th census, scheduled for 2021, was delayed to 2024 due to COVID-19 and economic crisis.
2. Digital-first census: For the first time, Sri Lanka used Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) with tablets and smartphones instead of paper forms.
3. Census blocks & maps: The country was divided into 98,430 digital census blocks across 14,008 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GN Divisions) in 340 Divisional Secretariats.
4. Roofless enumeration: People without usual residences (“roofless persons”) were counted nationwide on the night of 18 Dec 2024.
5. Long-term growth trend: Since the first census in 1871 (2.4M people), population rose steadily to 21.8M in 2024; however, growth rates peaked in 1953 (2.8%) and have steadily declined.
6. Urban concentration: Population density has climbed from 230/km² in 1981 → 349/km² in 2024, with Colombo (3,549/km²) far ahead of others.
7. Demographic pressure areas: High densities cluster in Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Kandy, Galle, Matara, and Jaffna.
8. Depopulation risk zones: Low-density regions (under 100/km²) include Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya, Kilinochchi, Moneragala, Anuradhapura, and Polonnaruwa.
9. Administrative changes: The number of GN Divisions dropped slightly (14,021 in 2012 → 14,008 in 2024), due to projects like Moragahakanda & Kaluganga reservoirs submerging villages.
10. Regional variation in growth: District-level growth shows contrast — Mullaitivu growing rapidly (2.23%) vs. Vavuniya stagnant (0.01%), highlighting uneven demographic trends.
